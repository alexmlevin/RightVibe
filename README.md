**RightVibe** is a cutting-edge tool designed to bridge the gap between visual content and tactile experience. It analyzes video input and intelligently interprets visual and auditory cues into synthesized haptic tracks.

Ideal for mobile app developers and content creators, RightVibe allows you to generate synchronized tactile feedback for any video, making your mobile experiences significantly more immersive and engaging.

## ✨ Features

* **Universal Video Input:** Accepts major video container formats (e.g., MP4, MOV, AVI) for analysis.
* **Intelligent Interpretation:** Uses advanced algorithms to detect impacts, motion, textures, and audio swells within the video content.
* **Mobile-Ready Output:** Generates standardized haptic track files ready for integration into iOS (AHAP) and Android ecosystems.
* **Customizable Intensity:** Fine-tune the gain and threshold of the generated haptics to match the desired vibe of your app.
