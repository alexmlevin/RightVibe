**RightVibe** is a tool designed to create .AHAP files based on AI's intepretation of a video or animation. It analyzes video input and intelligently interprets visual and auditory cues into synthesized haptic tracks.

Ideal for mobile app design and development teams, RightVibe allows you to generate synchronized tactile feedback for any video, making your mobile experiences significantly more immersive and engaging.
